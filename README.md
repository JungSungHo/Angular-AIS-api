# Angular AIS with TypeScript


## Running the Application

1. Install the latest LTS version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org. *IMPORTANT: The server uses ES2015 features AND the Angular CLI so you need a current version of Node.js.*

1. Run `npm install` to install app dependencies

1. Run `ng build --watch` to build and bundle the code

1. Run `npm start` in a separate terminal window to build the TypeScript, watch for changes and launch the web server

1. Go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser 


## Running Angular Playground

This application includes Angular Playground (http://www.angularplayground.it) which provides a great way to isolate components in a sandbox rather than loading the 
entire application to see a given component. To run the playground run the following command:

`npm run playground`
